<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The management of the distribution of wealth is a balancing act of many, often conflicting, incentives and policies. Virtually everyone agrees that the distribution of money “unfair”, yet determining what would be “fair”, though many ideas exist, have not been well tested let alone agreed upon. Although there are many things that make for one's quality of life, money is the primary tool for providing and acquiring necessities and luxuries. It is the primary method to manage the exchange of goods and services.</p>

<p>Our governments use tools like taxes and interest rates to manage our economy and keep it stable. The ways money flows through our economy are identifiable and measurable. With these ways identified and measured attempt to build a model showing how various incentives and policies affect the lives of people and the stability of the country. Once determined that this model is sufficient to describe how money is distributed from the poorest to richest, use the model, to try adjustments of those incentives and policies that we can control to better the lives of those now struggling to get by while at the same time encourage people, poor and rich, to strive to improve themselves and our country.</p>

<p>This is not an attempt to model the economy of the United States nor the “right or wrong” of various business practices and government policies. It is to determine how controllable incentives and policies can be adjusted to modify the distribution of wealth and quality of life.</p>

<p>Building the model is the easy part. It does not judge incentives and policies as to “moral”, “right or wrong”. It only provides a tool to test if changes will actually provide the desired outcome and not produce unexpected and undesirable side effects or instability of our economy. What is “moral” or “right or wrong” is up to our leaders and our country's people to decide.
The model could, given guidance on what is the desirable outcome, to adjust the manageable flows to find the optimal solution. Then it would still be up to the people to decide if it is acceptable.</p>
