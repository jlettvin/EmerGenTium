<h2>Build the Model</h2>

<p>To be defined.</p>

</p>As I understand it the model should be given initial conditions, at first – guesses for testing, then for real – actual conditions of the country and its people.
It should simulate the flow of money between nodes over time to determine what the eventual outcome of the flow will produce. The fun part is determining how the various methods of money flow affect each other. Like neurons communicate. Is this to be done through training or manually adjusted to get it to match reality?</p>

<p>I think that you are having the nodes that interact are the interactions between (people, businesses, governments). That the nodes that interact are not (people, businesses, governments) interacting with each other. I'm a little lost there.</p>

<p>How to determine whether interactions should be positive,  negative and to what degree? We can guess. Is it possible to define conditions at various times in the past, then attempt to let the model “find” the proper values for the interactions that accurately predict what will happen next, and how far it can predict future money flow, given that uncontrolled events like hurricanes of earth quakes or unexpected wars outside the USA are given to it. I feel that the goal of the model is to accurately predict the future without having us to tell it what is “right and wrong”. Hopefully the model is linear so the prediction and optimal solutions are unique. But I suspect that it will not be.</p>
